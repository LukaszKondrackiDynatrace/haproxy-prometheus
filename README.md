# HAProxy
The HAProxy (Prometheus) uses Prometheus to collect data remotely. Every minute, data is collected from HAProxy devices and is continuously analyzed by the Dynatrace platforms. The new framework allows you to go beyond simple metrics and apply a topology-first approach to monitoring.   

**This is intended for users, who:**
- Would like to monitor the performance of an edge proxy or ingress proxy 
- Focus on Kubernetes calls for supporting the most popular services of this kind in Kubernetes. 

**This enables you to:**
- Monitor infrastructure with a comprehensive dashboard 
- Use Prometheus as the data source 
- Take pre-emptive measures to avoid service degradations 

**Compatibility Requirements**
- HAProxy devices using Prometheus exporter
